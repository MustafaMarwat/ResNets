# Residual Network (ResNet) Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Residual Network (ResNet) using Keras. ResNet is a deep learning architecture designed to tackle the vanishing gradient problem in very deep networks.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Training**: ResNet enables the training of networks with hundreds or thousands of layers efficiently.

- **Skip Connections**: The core innovation lies in the introduction of skip connections, allowing gradients to flow through alternate shortcut paths.

- **Addressing Vanishing Gradient**: ResNet mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, ensuring effective learning in deep neural networks.

## Architecture

The implemented ResNet consists of multiple residual blocks, each addressing the vanishing gradient problem. The architecture is inspired by the original ResNet50 architecture proposed by He et al. in 2015.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Jupyter Notebook (if you want to run the Jupyter file)

## Usage
Run the ResNet implementation in a Jupyter notebook or integrate it into your own projects.

## Training
To train the model, use the provided dataset. Make sure to adjust hyperparameters as needed.

# Example training script
- python train.py

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model on a test dataset to assess its performance.

# Example evaluation script
- python evaluate.py
## Results
Provide insights into the performance of the trained model, including accuracy and loss metrics.

## Built With
- Keras
- TensorFlow
